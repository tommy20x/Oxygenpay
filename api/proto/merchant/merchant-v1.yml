    Welcome to the **Merchant API**!
    Here you can find all available endpoints for creating and processing payments.
    
    If you want to exercise the API via SDK for preferred language, you can easily generate one by
    downloading this spec (click the button above), then go to
    <a href="https://editor.swagger.io" target="_blank">Swagger Editor</a>, paste the spec and click "Generate Client"
    in top toolbar. If you're using Golang, we suggest generating SDK with
    <a href="https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger" target="_blank">go-swagger</a>.
    
    ## Authentication üîê
    API uses token based authentication that you need to provide in each request. `X-O2PAY-TOKEN` is used as key. 
    You can obtain API token in merchant's settings in dashboard at
    <a href="https://app.o2pay.co" target="_blank">app.o2pay.co</a>
    
    Example request:
    ```bash
      curl --header 'X-O2PAY-TOKEN: <your-token>' \
        https://api.o2pay.co/api/merchant/v1/merchant/5a51e7a5-f0c8-48dc-a9fb-a335481ae846/balance
    ```
    
    Unauthorized requests return `401 Unauthorized` response:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Unauthorized",
      "status": "token_error"
    }
    ```
